Supporting code and data for the article
----------------------------------------
"Local equations for the Generalized Lotka–Volterra model in sparse asymmetric graphs"

This repository contains the simulation code, numerical integration drivers, data, and
plotting scripts used to produce the results in the paper above. The repository is
organised so each major component lives in a separate folder and each folder contains
its own README describing how to build/run the code contained there.

Quick overview
--------------
- `BeliefPropagation/` — C code (and helper Python scripts) implementing continuous
  Belief Propagation (BP) on random regular graphs. Includes code to compute node
  marginal distributions and to scan phase-space for transition lines. See
  `BeliefPropagation/README.md` for build and usage instructions.

- `IBMF/` — Individual-Based Mean Field implementation (C++). Implements the
  stationary IBMF solution for the Generalised Lotka–Volterra model on sparse graphs
  including both T=0 and finite-T routines. See `IBMF/README.md` for compile/run
  instructions and options.

- `numerical_integration/` — Drivers and toolboxes for time-integration of the
  Generalised Lotka–Volterra dynamics on sparse graphs. Contains graph generators,
  integrators (adaptive Runge–Kutta, Milstein for demographic noise), and driver
  programs that produce the simulation results and summary files stored under `Data/`.
  A `Makefile` is provided in this folder. See `numerical_integration/README.md`.

- `Data/` — Data generated by the simulations, BP, and IBMF analyses. This folder
  contains subfolders grouped by experiment type and figure panel. Use the per-folder
  README files to find specific data files used by the plotting scripts.

- `Figures/` — Gnuplot (.plt) scripts that recreate the figures used in the paper.
  Each script references data files under `Data/`. See `Figures/` subfolder READMEs
  for per-panel instructions and dependencies.

- `.git/` and third-party libs — small vendor libraries (e.g. `eigen` used by the
  numerical integration code) live under `numerical_integration/` if needed.

How to reproduce results (quick start)
-------------------------------------
Below are the high-level steps to build and run the different components. For full,
component-specific instructions check the README contained in each folder.

Prerequisites (typical)
- Linux (or macOS with minor tweaks)
- g++ (C++ compiler)
- GCC toolchain (gcc/gfortran if present)
- GNU Scientific Library (GSL) for code that uses special functions and RNG
- Eigen (header-only) for numerical_integration (the repo contains an `eigen-3.4.0`
  copy used by the numerical_integration Makefile)
- gnuplot (to render .plt scripts into EPS/PNG)
- Python 3 with NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib (used by some postprocessing scripts)

Install common system deps (Debian/Ubuntu example):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libgsl-dev gnuplot python3 python3-pip
pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

1) Build IBMF

```bash
cd IBMF
# example compile; IBMF/README.md includes the recommended command
g++ -std=c++11 -O3 IBMF_LV_sequential.cpp -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -o IBMF_LV_sequential
```

2) Build numerical integration drivers

```bash
# uses the provided Makefile inside numerical_integration
make -C numerical_integration -j2
```

3) Build BP code

```bash
cd BeliefPropagation
# follow BeliefPropagation/README.md (C programs require -lgsl)
```

4) Recreate figures

From the repository root run the gnuplot scripts in `Figures/` which reference the data
in `Data/`:

```bash
# run individual gnuplot script
gnuplot Figures/Asymmetric/Langevin_T0_Lotka_Volterra_crossover.plt

# or run all scripts in a folder
for f in Figures/Asymmetric/*.plt; do
  echo "Running $f"
  gnuplot "$f"
done
```


Organisation and where to look
------------------------------
Use the following guide to find the code/data you need:
- To reproduce BP results: `BeliefPropagation/` and `Data/BP/`
- To reproduce IBMF results and related phase-diagrams: `IBMF/` and `Data/IBMF/`
- To reproduce time-integration / Langevin dynamics: `numerical_integration/` and
  `Data/Simulations/`
- To generate the paper figures: `Figures/` (each subfolder contains a README with
  the data dependencies and any small helper files used by the plotting scripts)
